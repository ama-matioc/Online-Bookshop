# Online Bookshop - Java Programming

This project aims to simplify the operations of an online bookshop, providing a good interface for both administrators and users. 

The client can either buy or borrow borrow a book, see book reviews or even add one, search for a book by title or author and see all the books available normally or ordered by price.

The administrator can add or delete a book from the inventory, display all the books in the inventory normally or ordered by price and search for a book by title or id.

I wanted to do this project to simplify the process of managing book inventories and because reading is one of my hobbies. I also wanted to introduce the idea of a bookshop where not only can you buy books but also borrow them.
